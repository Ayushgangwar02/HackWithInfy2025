## üéØ Problems Solved

### 1. Fractional Knapsack Problem (`GreedyApproach/knapShap.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of items with weights and values, and a knapsack with limited capacity, maximize the total value by selecting items (fractions allowed).

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Create an `Item` class to store value and weight
2. Sort items by value/weight ratio (highest first)
3. Greedily select items:
   - If item fits completely, take it entirely
   - If item doesn't fit, take fractional part
4. Return maximum value achieved

**Example:**
```
Items: [(value=60, weight=10), (value=100, weight=20), (value=120, weight=30)]
Capacity: 50
Ratios: [6.0, 5.0, 4.0]
Result: 60 + 100 + (120 * 20/30) = 240.0
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd GreedyApproach
javac knapShap.java
java GreedyApproach.knapShap
```

### 2. Activity Selection Problem (`GreedyApproach/ActivitySelection.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort activities by end time, select earliest ending non-conflicting activities
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Create an `Activity` class to store start and end times
2. Sort activities by end time (earliest first)
3. Greedily select activities:
   - Always select first activity
   - For remaining activities, select if start time ‚â• last selected end time
4. Return count of selected activities

**Example:**
```
Activities: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9)]
After sorting by end time: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9)]
Selected: (1,3), (5,7), (8,9)
Result: 3 activities
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd GreedyApproach
javac ActivitySelection.java
java GreedyApproach.ActivitySelection
```

### 3. Buy Two Chocolate Problem (`GreedyApproach/BuyTwoChocolate.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given an array of chocolate prices and an amount of money, find the leftover money after buying the two cheapest chocolates (if possible).

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort prices and select the two cheapest chocolates
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Sort the chocolate prices in ascending order
2. Take the two cheapest chocolates (first two elements after sorting)
3. Calculate total cost of the two cheapest chocolates
4. If total cost ‚â§ available money, return leftover money
5. Otherwise, return original money (can't afford two chocolates)

**Example:**
```
Prices: [1, 2, 2]
Money: 3
After sorting: [1, 2, 2]
Two cheapest: 1 + 2 = 3
Since 3 ‚â§ 3, leftover = 3 - 3 = 0
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd GreedyApproach
javac BuyTwoChocolate.java
java GreedyApproach.Solution
```

### 4. Array Partition Problem (`GreedyApproach/partition.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized.

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort the array and pair adjacent elements
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Sort the array in ascending order
2. Pair adjacent elements: (nums[0], nums[1]), (nums[2], nums[3]), etc.
3. Take the minimum of each pair (which will be the first element after sorting)
4. Sum all the minimums to get the maximum possible sum

**Key Insight:**
After sorting, pairing adjacent elements ensures that we minimize the "waste" - the larger element in each pair that doesn't contribute to the sum.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
After sorting: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6)
Sum of mins: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd GreedyApproach
javac partition.java
java GreedyApproach.partition
```
