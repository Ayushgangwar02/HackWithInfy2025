## üéØ Problems Solved

### 1. Fractional Knapsack Problem (`knapShap.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of items with weights and values, and a knapsack with limited capacity, maximize the total value by selecting items (fractions allowed).

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Create an `Item` class to store value and weight
2. Sort items by value/weight ratio (highest first)
3. Greedily select items:
   - If item fits completely, take it entirely
   - If item doesn't fit, take fractional part
4. Return maximum value achieved

**Example:**
```
Items: [(value=60, weight=10), (value=100, weight=20), (value=120, weight=30)]
Capacity: 50
Ratios: [6.0, 5.0, 4.0]
Result: 60 + 100 + (120 * 20/30) = 240.0
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
javac knapShap.java
java knapShap
```

### 2. Activity Selection Problem (`GreedyApproach/ActivitySelection.java`)

**Problem Statement:**
Given a set of activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

**Algorithm Approach:**
- **Greedy Strategy**: Sort activities by end time, select earliest ending non-conflicting activities
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Solution Explanation:**
1. Create an `Activity` class to store start and end times
2. Sort activities by end time (earliest first)
3. Greedily select activities:
   - Always select first activity
   - For remaining activities, select if start time ‚â• last selected end time
4. Return count of selected activities

**Example:**
```
Activities: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9)]
After sorting by end time: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,7), (8,9)]
Selected: (1,3), (5,7), (8,9)
Result: 3 activities
```

**How to Run:**
```bash
cd GreedyApproach
javac ActivitySelection.java
java GreedyApproach.ActivitySelection
```
